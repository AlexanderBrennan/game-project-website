        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We started by having a meeting to discuss what theme of game we wanted to make and what kind of story we
                wanted to tell</li>
            <li>We had a meeting while creating a Figma chart together to decide what code our game will need</li>
            <li>We then went through our Figma chart and decided on changes we could make</li>
            <li>We then decided on our story and fit it around our Figma chart</li>
            <li>We then split up our Figma chart into pieces of code that needed to be written and distrubuted it via
                Trello</li>
            <li>We then worked on our indivdual parts while talking and helping each other</li>
            <li>Once we had our code written we all went over it together to correct, make changes and error correct our
                code</li>
            <li>After all our code was written we imported all our code into one file to be stitched together which was
                a task that needed all of us</li>
            <li>When we got the code working we started to error test the full game to see if anything was broken or
                needed adjustments</li>
            <li>Once we got the game to a place we where happy with, we went through and added flavour text to give our
                game some life</li>
            <li>We did our final playthroughs and had friends of ours try the game to get some feedback that lead to
                some improvements</li>
            <li>With everything working and improvements made, we then proceeded to create this website that you're
                seeing now</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>What Went Well</h2>
            <p>We had great teamwork, I can't mention that enough, we had great communication, amazing planning and a
                smooth work flow.
                Our team members took and gave critism to each other with no complaints and even used it to improve, we
                where able to quite smoothly transition
                from our own indivual code segments and stitch it into a single file using all our own inputs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What We Would Do Differently</h2>
            <p>With the knowledge we have now I believe we would be more ambitious, we would make the game longer, add
                in more segments that would make the partner choice have a more unique feel,
                even add in more options to choose from, add in more puzzles to the game to make it more than just
                picking options down a path.
